# Haryana Roadways - Frontend Syntax Issues


## Deployment Summary

### What Was Done

1. **Fixed Multiple Code Syntax Errors**
   - `src/App.jsx`: Removed merge conflict markers and duplicate code blocks
   - `src/components/footer.jsx`: Fixed duplicate state declarations
   - `src/components/nav.jsx`: Restored clean version from origin/main branch
   - `src/utils/translationKeyMap.js`: Fixed malformed object structure (newsletter keys)

2. **Built Frontend for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Created optimized production build in `/dist` folder
   - Build size: ~20MB

## Deployment Summary

### What Was Done

1. **Fixed Multiple Code Syntax Errors**
   - `src/App.jsx`: Removed merge conflict markers and duplicate code blocks
   - `src/components/footer.jsx`: Fixed duplicate state declarations
   - `src/components/nav.jsx`: Restored clean version from origin/main branch
   - `src/utils/translationKeyMap.js`: Fixed malformed object structure (newsletter keys)

2. **Built Frontend for Production**
```bash
npm run build
```
   - Created optimized production build in `/dist` folder
   - Build size: ~20MB
   - Vite bundled 2263 modules successfully

3. **Started Backend Server in Production Mode**
```bash
cd /root/utils/travel/HrRoadways
NODE_ENV=production nohup node backend/mainServer.js > server.log 2>&1 &
```
   - Server running on port `50001`
   - Process ID saved in `server.pid`
   - Logs written to `server.log`
   - Backend serves both API (`/api/*`) and frontend (static files from `/dist`)

### Application Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18.3.1
- Vite 6.3.5 (build tool)
- React Router v7 (routing)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Clerk (authentication)
- i18next (internationalization)
- Leaflet (maps)
- Framer Motion (animations)

**Backend:**
- Express.js 4.21.2
- Node.js v22.21.0
- Port: 50001
- Environment: Production

### Server Management

**Check Server Status:**
```bash
ps aux | grep mainServer
# or
cat HrRoadways/server.pid
```

**View Logs:**
```bash
tail -f HrRoadways/server.log
```

**Restart Server:**
```bash
pkill -f "node.*mainServer.js"
cd /HrRoadways
NODE_ENV=production nohup node backend/mainServer.js > server.log 2>&1 &
```

**Test Locally:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:50001/api/health
curl http://localhost:50001/
```

### Files Modified

1. `HrRoadways/src/App.jsx` - Fixed syntax errors
2. `HrRoadways/src/components/footer.jsx` - Fixed duplicate states
3. `HrRoadways/src/components/nav.jsx` - Restored from git
4. `HrRoadways/src/utils/translationKeyMap.js` - Fixed object structure

### Backup Files Created

- `src/App.jsx.backup` - Original App.jsx before fixes

### Troubleshooting

**If the application doesn't load:**
1. Check server is running: `ps aux | grep mainServer`
2. Check logs: `tail -f server.log`
3. Test direct access: `curl http://localhost:50001/`

**If you see "route not found":**
- The frontend may not be built - run `npm run build`
- The server may be in development mode - ensure `NODE_ENV=production`
- Check that `/dist` folder exists with `ls -la dist/`

**If you see 502 Bad Gateway:**
- Server is down - restart using commands above
- Port 50001 not accessible - check firewall/server status

## Other issues fixed

The following additional issues were found and fixed during the debugging and deployment process. Include this list when filing an issue if you want to track remaining follow-ups:

- Search / data-fetching:
  - Replaced direct client fetch to a third-party JSON host (blocked by CORS) with a local `fallbackData` filter for reliable local testing. Recommend adding a server-side proxy or CORS-enabled API for production data.

- Newsletter / footer:
  - Removed an undefined `NewsletterProvider` reference and fixed the newsletter form handler (renamed `handleSubscribe` â†’ `handleNewsletterSubmit`) and duplicate state declarations in `src/components/footer.jsx`.

- Runtime handler errors:
  - Fixed several event handler mismatches and malformed JSX that caused runtime "is not a function" errors in compiled bundles (onFocus/onBlur and other handlers).

- Service worker & base path:
  - Noted that service-worker cache paths and Vite `base` must match the deployed subpath (e.g., `/haryana-roadways/`). These were adjusted during testing but the user requested local-first validation, so final subpath changes were not permanently applied here.

- Localization keys:
  - Corrected misplaced `newsletter` keys in `src/utils/translationKeyMap.js` that caused missing translations and console warnings.

- Navigation component:
  - Restored `src/components/nav.jsx` to the clean version from `origin/main` to remove merge-conflict artifacts and duplicated returns.

Follow-ups (recommended):

- Implement a backend proxy or server-side fetch for third-party JSON endpoints to avoid CORS issues in production.
- If deploying to a subpath (`/haryana-roadways/`) permanently, set Vite `base` to `/haryana-roadways/`, update service-worker paths, rebuild, and re-deploy.
