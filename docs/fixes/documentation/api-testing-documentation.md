# üìù API Testing Documentation

## üìù Description

Added comprehensive API testing documentation to help developers quickly test backend endpoints and understand API request/response formats.

---

## üìö Current Issue

**What was wrong or missing:**

1. **No API Testing Instructions in README**
   - README had setup instructions but no guidance on how to test the API
   - Developers couldn't verify if backend was working correctly
   - No quick examples for health check or smart route endpoints

2. **No Comprehensive API Documentation**
   - Missing detailed curl examples for all endpoints
   - No explanation of request/response formats
   - No troubleshooting guide for common API errors
   - No information about Google Maps API integration

3. **Unclear for Contributors**
   - New contributors couldn't easily test their changes
   - No standardized way to verify API functionality
   - Missing examples for different use cases (basic routes, no results, etc.)

---

## üß† Suggested Update

**Changes Made:**

### 1. README.md - Added "Testing the API" Section

**Location:** After "Backend Server" section, before "Popular Places Repository"

**Content Added:**
- Quick health check curl example
- Smart route POST request example with JSON payload
- Reference link to comprehensive documentation

**Example:**
```markdown
### Testing the API

**Health Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:50001/api/health
```

**Smart Route (Bus search):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:50001/api/smartRoute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source": "Chandigarh", "destination": "Delhi"}'
```

üìñ For comprehensive API documentation and more examples, see [`docs/curl_examples.md`](docs/curl_examples.md)
```

### 2. docs/curl_examples.md - Comprehensive API Documentation

## üîç Testing Results

**Verified Working:**

1. **Health Check Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   $ curl http://localhost:50001/api/health
   {"status":"OK","timestamp":"2025-10-23T17:30:45.123Z"}
   ```

2. **Smart Route Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   $ curl -X POST http://localhost:50001/api/smartRoute \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"source": "Chandigarh", "destination": "Delhi"}'
   
   # Returns multiple bus routes with travel time and distance
   ```
