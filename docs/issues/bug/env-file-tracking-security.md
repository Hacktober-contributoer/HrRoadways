**Description:**
The `.env` file containing sensitive API keys and credentials was being tracked by git and pushed to the repository despite being listed in `.gitignore`. This is a critical security issue as it exposes sensitive credentials including Clerk secret keys, Google Maps API key, and Weather API key to anyone with repository access.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Check git tracked files with `git ls-files | grep .env`
2. Observe that `.env` file is being tracked
3. Make changes to `.env` file
4. Run `git status` and see `.env` appears as modified
5. File gets pushed to remote repository despite `.gitignore` entry

**Expected Behavior:**
- `.env` file should be ignored by git as specified in `.gitignore`
- Changes to `.env` should not appear in `git status`
- `.env` should never be pushed to remote repository
- Only `.env.example` (template without secrets) should be tracked

**Actual Behavior:**
- `.env` file was being tracked by git
- File appeared in `git status` when modified
- Sensitive API keys and credentials were exposed in version control history
- `.gitignore` rules were ineffective because file was already committed before rule was added

**Screenshots or Logs:**
```bash
$ git ls-files | grep -E "^\.env$"
.env

$ cat .env
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=a88a791860616b06b7b7b8637de9af7b
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_ZmluZXItZGluZ28tNzUuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_ICbLnxX0mxXsJSKwH7fKmIlDvYBciHlAb4Y1fZikTB
PORT=50001
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyCMXj6FEhwStT2t6O6PiygUdV49FqbsR4Y
```

**Environment:**
- **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based)
- **Git Version:** 2.x
- **Repository:** haryana-roadways
- **Branch:** feature/frontend_rendering, frontend/ignore_env

**Additional Information:**
- **Root cause**: The `.env` file was committed to the repository before `.gitignore` rules were properly set up. Once a file is tracked by git, adding it to `.gitignore` does not stop tracking existing files.

- **Security implications**:
  - Exposed Clerk secret key (authentication)
  - Exposed Google Maps API key (potential billing abuse)
  - Exposed Weather API key
  - All historical commits contain these credentials

- **Fix applied**:
  1. Removed `.env` from git tracking using `git rm --cached .env`
  2. Created `.env.example` as a template for contributors
  3. Committed the removal to stop future tracking
  4. Local `.env` file preserved for development

- **Recommended follow-up actions**:
  1. **Rotate all exposed API keys immediately**:
     - Regenerate Clerk secret key in Clerk dashboard
     - Regenerate Google Maps API key in Google Cloud Console
     - Regenerate Weather API key
  2. Add `.env.example` to repository as template
  3. Update documentation to explain environment setup
  4. Consider using git history rewriting tools (BFG Repo-Cleaner) to remove `.env` from all historical commits
  5. Add pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental commits of sensitive files

- **Does the issue happen always?**: Yes, until the file is removed from git tracking

- **Did the issue start after an update?**: No, this was an existing issue from initial repository setup

**Priority Level:**
- [x] Level 1 (Critical - Security vulnerability with exposed credentials)
- [ ] Level 2
- [ ] Level 3

**Resolution:**
Fixed by removing `.env` from git tracking while preserving local file. All exposed API keys should be rotated immediately as they are now considered compromised.
